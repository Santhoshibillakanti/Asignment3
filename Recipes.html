            <h3>   Fresh Herb Salad</h3>
            <p>This simple salad shows off herbs at their best. It makes a lovely accompaniment to seared steaks or fish.</p>
         </div>
         <div class= "Recipie2">
            <h3>Strawberry-Rhubarb Blitz Torte</h3>
            <p>Possibly called “blitz” because the stunning cake can be baked, cooled, and assembled quickly compared to traditional layer cakes, this dessert is a showstopper. Tender, golden cake layers are topped with sweet, crunchy meringue and sandwich a tangy strawberry-rhubarb filling.</p>
         </div>
         <div class= "Recipie3">
            <h3>Herbed Dutch Baby with Creamy Mushrooms and Leeks</h3>
            <p>Dutch babies are the perfect canvas for all kinds of accompaniments, and hearty toppings make them into full meals. The batter for this Dutch baby is loaded with chopped fresh herbs, and the pancake is piled high with a rich mixture of mushrooms and leeks.</p>

         <div class= "Recipie4">
            <h3>Fudge Cookie and Coconut Ice Cream Sandwiches</h3>
            <p>This is my go-to chocolate cookie for ice cream sandwiches. I’ve yet to discover an ice cream flavor it doesn’t pair well with. Toasted unsweetened coconut in the ice cream provides coconut flavor without making it too sweet, and toasted sweetened coconut on the outside of the cookie gives a pleasantly crunchy texture all coconut lovers will enjoy.</p>
         </div>

            <h3>Brown Sugar Cookie and Espresso Ice Cream Sandwiches</h3>
            <p>Store-bought coffee ice cream is often too tame. If you make your own from a vanilla ice cream base, you can give it more punch with instant espresso powder. To match the intense espresso flavor, you need a strongly flavored cookie like this one with brown sugar and molasses.</p>
         </div>
		 <div class= "Recipie6">
            <h3>Chicken Burgers with Lime, Pepper, and Pickle</h3>
            <p>Who knew a burger could taste so light and bright? Lime zest and juice as well as fresh cilantro and red bell pepper brighten this one beautifully. Don’t leave off the pickle; that little bit of tang and crunch makes a big difference.</p>
         </div>
		 <div class= "Recipie7">
            <h3>Sliced Rib-Eye and Mushroom Salad with Basil Dressing</h3>
            <p>A dressing made with fresh basil makes steak and mushrooms feel summery, and crispy onions add flavor and crunch. This is the dish to turn to when you’re looking to impress your midweek guests.</p>
         </div> 
         <div class= "Recipie8">
            <h3>Avocado Stuffed with Chicken, Radishes, Feta, and Cilantro</h3>
            <p>The ultimate no-cook summer meal, these stuffed avocados are refreshing and light but also deliciously satisfying. Round out the meal with a salad on the side.</p>
