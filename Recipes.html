<h3>   Fresh Herb Salad</h3>
<p>This simple salad shows off herbs at their best. It makes a lovely accompaniment to seared steaks or fish.</p>

<h3>Strawberry-Rhubarb Blitz Torte</h3> 
<p>Possibly called “blitz” because the stunning cake can be baked, cooled, and assembled quickly compared to traditional layer cakes, this dessert is a showstopper. Tender, golden cake layers are topped with sweet, crunchy meringue and sandwich a tangy strawberry-rhubarb filling.</p>

<h3>Herbed Dutch Baby with Creamy Mushrooms and Leeks</h3> 
<p>Dutch babies are the perfect canvas for all kinds of accompaniments, and hearty toppings make them into full meals. The batter for this Dutch baby is loaded with chopped fresh herbs, and the pancake is piled high with a rich mixture of mushrooms and leeks.</p>

<h3>Fudge Cookie and Coconut Ice Cream Sandwiches</h3> 
<p>This is my go-to chocolate cookie for ice cream sandwiches. I’ve yet to discover an ice cream flavor it doesn’t pair well with. Toasted unsweetened coconut in the ice cream provides coconut flavor without making it too sweet, and toasted sweetened coconut on the outside of the cookie gives a pleasantly crunchy texture all coconut lovers will enjoy.</p>
